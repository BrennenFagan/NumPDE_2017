# Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations
This repository contains the course materials for this module taught at the 
Department of Mathematics of the University of York in Spring 2017.

Students on the module are encouraged to fork the repository so that they
can modify the course materials for their own purposes. Also we would
appreciate pull requests for suggested corrections and improvements.
